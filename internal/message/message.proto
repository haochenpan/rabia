  message.proto defines types of messages that should be passed from/to clients and among server layers (i.e., proxy,
  consensus, and network).

  When you want to modify this file:
    If you want to change formats/fields of messaging objects, install (gogo)protobuf through the steps below on your
    developer machine (e.g., your Mac) only.

  How to install (gogo)protobuf:
  step 0
    set your GOPATH. I have the following line in my ~/.bash_profile:
      export GOPATH=${HOME}/go
    add the following directory to your PATH:
      ${HOME}/go/bin
  step 1, see: https://github.com/gogo/protobuf#installation
    install Go, make sure the go binary is in the system PATH
    install protoc: I grabbed the binary named protoc-3.15.6-osx-x86_64.zip for my Mac, and put it under ${GOPATH}/bin.
    include some source code: I also moved the google/protobuf folder inside the include folder to
    $GOPATH/src/google/protobuf

  step 2, run
    go get -u google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
    if you get some timeout error, try:
      git clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go.git
      rename the protobuf-go folder to protobuf, and put it under $GOPATH/src/google.golang.org
      run: go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go

  step 3, see: https://github.com/gogo/protobuf#speed
    run the followings to instal gogo-protobuf:
      go get github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gofast
      go get github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gogofaster
      go get github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gogoslick
    you can even install more extensions, check https://github.com/gogo/protobuf#more-speed-and-more-generated-code

  step 4, modify this file and comment/uncomment gogo-protobuf/protobuf headers of this file according to the use case

  step 5, to recompile this file, run:
    cd ~/go/src/rabia/internal/message

    if you want to use gogo-protobuf:
      protoc -I=. -I=$GOPATH/src -I=$GOPATH/src/github.com/gogo/protobuf/protobuf --gogoslick_out=. ./message.proto

    if you want to use the vanilla protobuf:
      protoc -I=. -I=$GOPATH/src -I=<path to the unzip-ed include folder>/google/protobuf --go_out=. ./message.proto
    mine is:
      protoc -I=. -I=$GOPATH/src -I=$GOPATH/src/google/protobuf --go_out=. ./message.proto

/*
  Command is used from client to proxy and from proxy to client only. When a client sends a Command message to a proxy,
  the message carries one or more client requests/commands/proposals to be appended to the replicated log. The SvrSeq
  field is not used. When a proxy sends a Command message to a connected client, the message carries the agreed proposal
  and the slot number in the SvrSeq field.

  If the client batch size = 1, a valid Command object looks like:
  Command{CliId: 0, CliSeq: 1000, SvrSeq: 0, Commands: ["0key1val1"]}

  If the client batch size = 3, a valid Command object looks like:
  Command{CliId: 0, CliSeq: 1001, SvrSeq: 0, Commands: ["0key1val1", "0key2val2", "1key3"]}

  CliId:  the from/to client id
  CliSeq: the client sequence
  SvrSeq: the decided slot # (from proxy to client only)
  Commands:
      each command in the array looks is of the form <operation type><key>[<value>], e.g., 0key1val1 and 1key2 are
      both valid. Regarding the operation type, 0 stands for a write operation and 1 stands for a read operation.

  Each command is a string of 17 bytes (modifiable through Conf.KeyLen and Conf.ValLen)
    [0:1]   (1 byte): "0" == a write operation,  "1" == a read operation
    [1:9]  (8 bytes): a string Key
    [9:17] (8 bytes): a string Value

/*
  To pass around a ConsensusObj among layers, embed it as a field of a Msg object because then we only need to keep Msg
  channels for inter-layer communications.

  If the client batch size = 1 and the proxy batch size = 1, valid ConsensusObj objects look like:
  ConsensusObj {ProId: 4, ProSeq: 500, SvrSeq: 714, IsNull: true}
  ConsensusObj {ProId: 4, ProSeq: 500, SvrSeq: 714, IsNull: false, CliIds: [0], CliSeqs: [1000],
    Commands: ["0key1val1"]}

    CliSeqs: [1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004], Commands: ["0k1v1", "1k2", "0k3v3",
    "1k4", "0k5v5", "1k6", "0k7v7", "1k8", "0k9v9", "1k10"]}

    "1k4", "0k5v5", "1k6", "0k1v1", "1k2", "0k3v3", "1k4"]}

  ProId:    the id of the proxy that initiates this object
  ProSeq:   the sequence of this object
  SvrSeq:   the decision slot number (0 could mean unassigned / decision in process)
  IsNull:   true if this slot is a NULL slot. if false, the following fields are used, see valid formats above
  CliIds:   the client id's that are associated with commands
  CliSeqs:  the client sequences that are associated with commands
  Commands: the clients' commands
